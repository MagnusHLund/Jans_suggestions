# Jans_suggestions
Simple website for Jan.

A simple idea for a topic that came up, during a live stream on MrWuus channel.

This website allows viewers to suggest which games that Jan should play in the weekends, when he isnt playing DBD.

The website itself consists of his banner icon, 2 input text fields and a submit button.
The footer contains links to his social media platforms.
